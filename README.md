# credit-risk-classification

This project focuses on applying machine learning models to classify the credit risk of loan applicants. The objective is to predict whether a loan is high risk (1) or healthy (0) using financial data and borrower attributes. The model can be used to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.
